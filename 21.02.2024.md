# SQL

## Task 00
## Let’s make a simple aggregation, please write a SQL statement that returns person identifiers and corresponding number of visits in any pizzerias and sorting by count of visits in descending mode and sorting in person_id in ascending mode. Please take a look at the sample of data below.  
```sql
SELECT person_id, COUNT(person_id) AS count_of_visits FROM person_visits
GROUP BY person_id
ORDER BY count_of_visits DESC, person_id;
```

## Task 01 
## Please change a SQL statement from Exercise 00 and return a person name (not identifier). Additional clause is we need to see only top-4 persons with maximal visits in any pizzerias and sorted by a person name. Please take a look at the example of output data below
```sql
WITH ex01 AS (
    SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS count_of_visits
    FROM person_visits
    JOIN person ON person.id = person_visits.person_id
    GROUP BY name
    ORDER BY count_of_visits DESC, name
)
SELECT * FROM(SELECT * FROM ex01 LIMIT 4) AS output;
```

## Task 02
## Please write a SQL statement to see 3 favorite restaurants by visits and by orders in one list (please add an action_type column with values ‘order’ or ‘visit’, it depends on data from the corresponding table). Please take a look at the sample of data below. The result should be sorted by action_type column in ascending mode and by count column in descending mode.
```sql
WITH orders AS
    (
        SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS count, 'order' AS action_type
        FROM person_order
        JOIN menu ON menu.id = person_order.menu_id
        JOIN pizzeria ON menu.pizzeria_id = pizzeria.id
        GROUP BY name
        ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 3
),
    visits AS
   (
        SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS count, 'visit' AS action_type
        FROM person_visits
        JOIN pizzeria ON pizzeria.id = person_visits.pizzeria_id
        GROUP BY name
        ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 3
)
SELECT * FROM orders
UNION
SELECT * FROM visits
ORDER BY action_type, count DESC;
```

## Task 03
## Please write a SQL statement to see restaurants are grouping by visits and by orders and joined with each other by using restaurant name.
## You can use internal SQLs from Exercise 02 (restaurants by visits and by orders) without limitations of amount of rows.
## Additionally, please add the next rules.
## calculate a sum of orders and visits for corresponding pizzeria (be aware, not all pizzeria keys are presented in both tables).
## sort results by total_count column in descending mode and by name in ascending mode. Take a look at the data sample below.  
```sql
WITH orders AS
    (
        SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS count, 'order' AS action_type
        FROM person_order
        JOIN menu ON menu.id = person_order.menu_id
        JOIN pizzeria ON menu.pizzeria_id = pizzeria.id
        GROUP BY name
        ORDER BY count DESC
),
    visits AS
    (
        SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS count, 'visit' AS action_type
        FROM person_visits
        JOIN pizzeria ON pizzeria.id = person_visits.pizzeria_id
        GROUP BY name
        ORDER BY count DESC
)
SELECT pizzeria.name, COALESCE(visits.count, 0) + COALESCE(orders.count, 0) AS total_count FROM pizzeria
FULL JOIN orders ON orders.name = pizzeria.name
FULL JOIN visits ON visits.name = pizzeria.name
ORDER BY total_count DESC, name;
```

## Task 04
## Please write a SQL statement that returns the person name and corresponding number of visits in any pizzerias if the person has visited more than 3 times (> 3).Please take a look at the sample of data below. 
```sql
SELECT person.name, COUNT(person_id) AS count_of_visits FROM person_visits
JOIN person ON person.id = person_visits.person_id
GROUP BY person.name
HAVING COUNT(person) >= 3;
```

## Task 05
## Please write a simple SQL query that returns a list of unique person names who made orders in any pizzerias. The result should be sorted by person name. Please take a look at the sample below.  
```sql

## Task 06
## Please write a SQL statement that returns the amount of orders, average of price, maximum and minimum prices for sold pizza by corresponding pizzeria restaurant. The result should be sorted by pizzeria name. Please take a look at the data sample below. Round your average price to 2 floating numbers.  
```sql

```

## Task 07
## Please write a SQL statement that returns a common average rating (the output attribute name is global_rating) for all restaurants. Round your average rating to 4 floating numbers.  
```sql

```

## Task 08
## We know about personal addresses from our data. Let’s imagine, that particular person visits pizzerias in his/her city only. Please write a SQL statement that returns address, pizzeria name and amount of persons’ orders. The result should be sorted by address and then by restaurant name. Please take a look at the sample of output data below.
```sql

```

## Task 09
## Please write a SQL statement that returns aggregated information by person’s address , the result of “Maximal Age - (Minimal Age / Maximal Age)” that is presented as a formula column, next one is average age per address and the result of comparison between formula and average columns (other words, if formula is greater than average then True, otherwise False value).
## The result should be sorted by address column. Please take a look at the sample of output data below.
```sql
