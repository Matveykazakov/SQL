# SQL

## Task - 00  
### Please write a SQL statement which returns menu’s identifier and pizza names from menu table and person’s identifier and person name from person table  in one global list (with column names as presented on a sample below) ordered by object_id and then by object_name columns.
```sql
SELECT id as object_id, name as object_name FROM person
UNION ALL
SELECT id as object_id, pizza_name as object_name FROM menu
ORDER BY object_id, object_name
```

## Task - 01  
### Please modify a SQL statement from “exercise 00” by removing the object_id column. Then change ordering by object_name for part of data from the `person` table and then from `menu` table (like presented on a sample below). Please save duplicates!
```sql
SELECT object_name FROM (
	SELECT name AS object_name, 'person' as type FROM person
	UNION ALL
	SELECT pizza_name, 'pizza' FROM menu
	ORDER BY type, object_name
	) as tab
```

## Task - 02  
### Please write a SQL statement which returns unique pizza names from the `menu` table and orders by pizza_name column in descending mode. Please pay attention to the Denied section.
```sql

ORDER BY pizza_name DESC;

## Task - 03  
### Please write a SQL statement which returns common rows for attributes order_date, person_id from `person_order` table from one side and visit_date, person_id from `person_visits` table from the other side (please see a sample below). In other words, let’s find identifiers of persons, who visited and ordered some pizza on the same day. Actually, please add ordering by action_date in ascending mode and then by person_id in descending mode.
```sql
SELECT visit_date, person_id FROM person_visits
UNION ALL
SELECT order_date, person_id FROM person_order 
ORDER BY visit_date, person_id DESC; 
```

## Task - 04  
### Please write a SQL statement which returns a difference (minus) of person_id column values with saving duplicates between `person_order` table and `person_visits` table for order_date and visit_date are for 7th of January of 2022
```sql
SELECT visit_date, person_id FROM person_visits
WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-07' 
INTERSECT 
SELECT order_date, person_id FROM person_order 
WHERE order_date = '2022-01-07'; 
```
