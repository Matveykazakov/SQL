## Task - 06  
### Let's return our mind back to exercise #03 and change our SQL statement to return person names instead of person identifiers and change ordering by action_date in ascending mode and then by person_name in descending mode. Please take a look at a data sample below.
```sql
SELECT visit_date, person.name FROM person
JOIN (SELECT visit_date, person_id FROM person_visits
INTERSECT
SELECT order_date, person_id FROM person_order 
ORDER BY visit_date, person_id DESC) as tab ON person_id = person.id
```

## Task - 07  
### Please write a SQL statement which returns the date of order from the `person_order` table and corresponding person name (name and age are formatted as in the data sample below) which made an order from the `person` table. Add a sort by both columns in ascending mode.
```sql
SELECT visit_date, person.name || '(age:'|| person.age || ')' as person_information FROM person
JOIN (SELECT visit_date, person_id FROM person_visits
INTERSECT
SELECT order_date, person_id FROM person_order 
ORDER BY visit_date, person_id) as tab ON person_id = person.id
```

## Task - 08  
### Please rewrite a SQL statement from exercise #07 by using NATURAL JOIN construction. The result must be the same like for exercise #07.  
```sql
SELECT order_date, p.name ||'(Age:' || p.age ||')' as
person_information FROM
(SELECT order_date, person_id FROM person_order) as p_o
NATURAL JOIN person p;
```
