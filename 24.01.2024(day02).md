Please order by visiting days in ascending mode. The sample of data with column name is presented below.
```sql
SELECT days::date FROM generate_series('2022-01-01', '2022-01-10', interval '1 day') AS days
LEFT JOIN
		(SELECT missing_days::date AS missing_day, pv.visit_date FROM generate_series('2022-01-01', '2022-01-10', interval '1 day') AS missing_days
		JOIN person_visits pv ON pv.visit_date = missing_days.missing_days
		WHERE pv.person_id = 1 OR pv.person_id = 2) AS tab
	ON days.days = tab.visit_date
WHERE tab.visit_date IS NULL;
```

SELECT 	
	COALESCE(p.name, '-'),
	pv.visit_date,
	pi.name
FROM person p 
	LEFT JOIN person_visits pv ON pv.person_id = p.id AND pv.visit_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' and '2022-01-03'
	RIGHT JOIN pizzeria pi on pi.id = pv.pizzeria_id
ORDER BY 1,2,3;

### Let’s return back to Exercise #01, please rewrite your SQL by using the CTE (Common Table Expression) pattern. Please move into the CTE part of your "day generator". The result should be similar like in Exercise #01
```sql
WITH days AS( 
	SELECT days::date FROM generate_series('2022-01-01', '2022-01-10', interval '1 day') AS days
	LEFT JOIN
		(SELECT missing_days::date AS missing_day, pv.visit_date FROM generate_series('2022-01-01', '2022-01-10', interval '1 day') AS missing_days
		JOIN person_visits pv ON pv.visit_date = missing_days.missing_days
		WHERE pv.person_id = 1 OR pv.person_id = 2) AS tab
	ON days.days = tab.visit_date
	WHERE tab.visit_date IS NULL
) 
SELECT * FROM days;
```
