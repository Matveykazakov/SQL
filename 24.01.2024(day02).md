LEFT JOIN
		(SELECT missing_days::date AS missing_day, pv.visit_date FROM generate_series('2022-01-01', '2022-01-10', interval '1 day') AS missing_days
		JOIN person_visits pv ON pv.visit_date = missing_days.missing_days

		JOIN person_visits pv ON pv.visit_date = missing_days.missing_days
		WHERE pv.person_id = 1 OR pv.person_id = 2) AS tab
	ON days.days = tab.visit_date
	WHERE tab.visit_date IS NULL
) 
SELECT * FROM days;
