## Task - 01  
### Please use 2 Database Views from Exercise #00 and write SQL to get female and male person names in one list. Please set the order by person name. The sample of data is presented below.
```sql
SELECT name FROM v_persons_male

## Task - 02  
### Please create a Database View (with name v_generated_dates) which should be “store” generated dates from 1st to 31th of January 2022 in DATE type. Don’t forget about order for the generated_date column.
```sql
CREATE VIEW v_generated_dates AS
(SELECT days::DATE AS generated_date
 FROM generate_series('2022-01-01', '2022-01-31', interval '1 day') AS days
 ORDER BY generated_date
);
SELECT * FROM v_generated_dates;
```

## Task - 03  
### Please write a SQL statement which returns missing days for persons’ visits in January of 2022. Use v_generated_dates view for that task and sort the result by missing_date column. The sample of data is presented below.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT generated_date AS missing_date
FROM v_generated_dates
LEFT JOIN person_visits 
    ON v_generated_dates.generated_date = person_visits.visit_date
	WHERE person_visits.visit_date IS NULL
ORDER BY missing_date;
```

## Task - 04  
### Please write a SQL statement which satisfies a formula (R - S)∪(S - R) . Where R is the person_visits table with filter by 2nd of January 2022, S is also person_visits table but with a different filter by 6th of January 2022. Please make your calculations with sets under the person_id column and this column will be alone in a result. The result please sort by person_id column and your final SQL please present in v_symmetric_union (*) database view.
```sql
CREATE VIEW v_symmetric_union AS (
     (SELECT person_id FROM person_visits
        WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-02'
    	EXCEPT
      SELECT person_id FROM person_visits
      WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-06')
      UNION
    (SELECT person_id FROM person_visits
        WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-06'
        EXCEPT
        SELECT person_id FROM person_visits
        WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-02')
);
SELECT * FROM v_symmetric_union
```

## Task - 05  
### Please create a Database View v_price_with_discount that returns a person's orders with person names, pizza names, real price and calculated column discount_price (with applied 10% discount and satisfies formula price - price*0.1). The result please sort by person name and pizza name and make a round for discount_price column to integer type. Please take a look at a sample result below.
```sql
CREATE VIEW v_price_with_discount AS
(SELECT DISTINCT
    name,
    pizza_name,
    price,
    CAST(price - price * 0.1 AS INTEGER) AS discount_price
FROM person_order
JOIN menu ON person_order.menu_id = menu.id
JOIN person on person_order.person_id = person.id
ORDER BY name, pizza_name
);
SELECT * FROM v_price_with_discount;
```

## Task - 06  
### Please create a Materialized View mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats (with data included) based on SQL statement that finds the name of pizzeria Dmitriy visited on January 8, 2022 and could eat pizzas for less than 800 rubles (this SQL you can find out at Day #02 Exercise #07). To check yourself you can write SQL to Materialized View mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats and compare results with your previous query.
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats AS ( 
	SELECT
		pizzeria.name AS pizzeria_name
    FROM person_visits
    INNER JOIN person ON person_visits.person_id = person.id
    JOIN menu ON person_visits.pizzeria_id = menu.pizzeria_id
    JOIN pizzeria ON menu.pizzeria_id= pizzeria.id
    WHERE person.name = 'Dmitriy' AND visit_date = '2022-01-08' AND price < 800
    GROUP BY pizzeria.name
    ORDER BY pizzeria_name
);
SELECT * FROM mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats;
```

## Task - 07  
### Let's refresh data in our Materialized View mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats from exercise #06. Before this action, please generate one more Dmitriy visit that satisfies the SQL clause of Materialized View except pizzeria that we can see in a result from exercise #06. After adding a new visit please refresh a state of data for mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats.
```sql
INSERT INTO person_visits(id, person_id, pizzeria_id, visit_date)
VALUES (
        (SELECT MAX(id) FROM person_visits) + 1,
        (SELECT id FROM person WHERE name = 'Dmitriy'),
        (SELECT DISTINCT
            pizzeria.id
            FROM pizzeria
            INNER JOIN menu ON pizzeria.id = menu.pizzeria_id
            JOIN mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats AS mv ON mv.pizzeria_name != pizzeria.name
            WHERE menu.price < 800 LIMIT 1),
        '2022-01-08'
);
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats;
SELECT * FROM mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats
```

## Task - 08  
### After all our exercises were born a few Virtual Tables and one Materialized View. Let’s drop them!
```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats;
DROP VIEW v_symmetric_union;
DROP VIEW v_generated_dates;
DROP VIEW v_price_with_discount;
DROP VIEW v_persons_male;
DROP VIEW v_persons_female;
```
